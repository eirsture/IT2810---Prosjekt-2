    "text": "i would sit in the center of the world,
    the Black Hills hooped around me and
    dream of my dancing horse. my wife
    
    was Black Shawl who gave me the daughter
    i called They Are Afraid Of Her.
    i was afraid of nothing
    
    except Black Buffalo Woman.
    my love for her i wore
    instead of feathers. i did not dance
    
    i dreamed. i am dreaming now
    across the worlds. my medicine is strong.
    my medicine is strong in the Black basket
    of these fingers. i come again through this
    
    Black Buffalo woman. hear me;
    the hoop of the world is breaking.
    fire burns in the four directions.
    the dreamers are running away from the hills.
    i have seen it. i am crazy horse."

    and the Galilean women were wet
    with butterflies and dew,
    dancing above chrysanthemum
    
    The two absent ones: you and I
    you and I are the two absent ones
    
    A pair of white doves
    chatting on the branches of a holm oak
    
    No love, but I love ancient
    love poems that guard
    the sick moon from smoke
    
    I attack and retreat, like the violin in quatrains
    I get far from my time when I am near
    the topography of place ...
    
    There is no margin in modern language left
    to celebrate what we love,
    because all that will be ... was
    
    The horse fell bloodied
    with my poem
    and I fell bloodied
    with the horse’s blood ..."

    eat that violin

cried Chagall’s mother

           But he   
kept right on
           painting

And became famous

And kept on painting
    The Horse With Violin In Mouth

And when he finally finished it
he jumped up upon the horse
              and rode away   
waving the violin

And then with a low bow gave it
to the first naked nude he ran across


And there were no strings   
           attached"

    contented and pensive,
    she holds in one hand,
    loosely, the reins of summer:
    
    the green of trees and bushes;
    the blue of lake water;
    the red of her jacket
    and open collar; the brown
    of her pinned-up hair,
    and her horse, deep
    in the yellow of sunflowers.
    
    When she stops to rest,
    summer rests.
    When she decides to leave,
    there goes summer
    over the hill."
