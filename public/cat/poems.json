    warm fur,
    a perfect fire
    to lie beside,
    a cozy lap
    where I can nap,
    an empty chair
    when she's not there.
    I want heat
         on my feet
         on my nose
         on my hide.
    No cat I remember
    dislikes December
         inside."

    aches to fly—
    she dreams all day of
    wings and sky!
    
    So tonight
    she climbs the ladder,
    mounts a platform,
    nothing matters
    
    except to catch
    a thin trapeze
    then hold on tight
    with grace and ease.
    
    She swings herself
    by both front paws
    then somesaults
    to wild applause
    
    of kitchen mice,
    who, though dizzy,
    encourage Cat,
    to keep her busy."

    "text": "A figment, a thumbed
    maquette of a cat, some
    ditched plaything, something
    brought in from outside:
    his white fur stiff and grey,
    coming apart at the seams.
    I study the muzzle
    of perished rubber, one ear
    eaten away, his sour body
    lumped like a bean-bag
    leaking thinly
    into a grim towel. I sit
    and watch the light
    degrade in his eyes.
    
    He tries and fails
    to climb to his chair, shirks
    in one corner of the kitchen,
    cowed, denatured, ceasing to be
    anything like a cat,
    and there's a new look
    in those eyes
    that refuse to meet mine
    and it's the shame of  being
    found out.  Just that.
    And with that
    loss of face
    his face, I see,
    has turned human."
